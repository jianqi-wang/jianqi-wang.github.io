# Welcome!
I am currently a Master's graduate in Economics from [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), expecting to graduate in September 2024. During my graduate studies, my favorite course was "Data Science for Business," in which I achieved a high score of 16/20. This course included both theoretical and practical components:

## Theory:
I studied various aspects of data science applied to business contexts (as detailed in the course outline).
- **Machine Learning**: Decision trees, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), regression, artificial neural networks, and deep learning.
- **Data Preprocessing and Postprocessing**: Data cleaning, transformation, validation techniques.
- **Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics**: Fraud analytics, credit risk modeling, clustering, and causal machine learning.

## Application:
 I focused on fraud analytics and credit risk modeling for Basel/IFRS9. I also worked on a credit risk modeling project using Python, which can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jianqi-wang/Credit-Risk-Modeling).
